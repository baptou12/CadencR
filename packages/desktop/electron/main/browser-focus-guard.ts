 * Stops a guest page from stealing the renderer's focus while the agent drives
 * the browser. Acting on a guest element — a synthetic click, `el.focus()` in a
 * fill, typed input — pulls native focus onto its WebContentsView and blurs
 * whatever the user was doing in the renderer (most visibly, the agent prompt).
 *
 * `run` brackets an agent (MCP) tool call: if the renderer held focus going in,
 * any guest `focus` event that fires during the call (or just after it) bounces
 * focus straight back to the main window. User-driven browser focus is left
 * alone — the guard only reclaims while an agent tool is in flight.

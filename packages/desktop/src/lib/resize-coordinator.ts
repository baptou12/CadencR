/**
 * Global "is the user actively dragging a resize handle?" flag.
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * react-resizable-panels resizes panel children per pointer-move. Heavy
 * children (xterm, agent stream, CodeMirror, …) each register their own
 * `ResizeObserver` to react to layout changes — and those observers run a
 * batch per animation frame. During an active drag, the cumulative cost of
 * every observer firing per frame (xterm refit, scroll-bottom catch-up with
 * forced sync layout reads, virtualization remeasures, …) snowballs into
 * sub-30 fps drags, especially with multiple split panes visible.
 *
 * We can't disable the observers entirely — they're needed for normal
 * mount/grow/shrink flows. But during a *manual* resize drag, the user
 * doesn't want auto-scroll-to-bottom or a per-frame xterm refit; they want
 * the panel boundary to follow their pointer at 60+ fps. So observers
 * subscribe to this coordinator, skip work while a drag is in progress, and
 * run a single catch-up pass when the drag ends.
 *
 * Wiring
 * ------
 * Each `<ResizableHandle>` calls `registerHandle(el)` on mount and
 * `unregisterHandle(el)` on unmount. The first registration installs a
 * single document-level *capture-phase* `pointerdown` listener that uses
 * geometric proximity (matching react-resizable-panels' own hit detection)
 * to decide whether a click is going to start a drag. On a hit it calls
 * `pushResize()` and arms window-level `pointerup` / `pointercancel`
 * listeners that call `popResize()`. Heavy observers subscribe via
 * `subscribeResize(cb)`.
 *
 * Why document-level (and not per-element)
 * ----------------------------------------
 * react-resizable-panels accepts clicks within ~5 px of a 1 px handle
 * (default `resizeTargetMinimumSize.fine = 10`, expanded centered around the
 * handle bbox). It uses geometric hit-testing, *not* DOM event targeting. A
 * per-element pointerdown listener only fires when the browser routes the
 * event to the handle node itself — and the handle's `::after` hit-zone
 * loses CSS stacking on the right side of a split (sibling main-panel
 * descendants paint above it). Clicks the library accepts can therefore
 * land on a non-handle element, the per-element listener never fires, and
 * `pushResize` never runs — surfacing as "slow drag sometimes" with no
 * freeze engaged. A document-level capture listener that matches against
 * the registered handles by coordinates dodges the issue entirely.
 *
 * Notification semantics
 * ----------------------
 * Every `pushResize()` fires `notify(true)`, even when `activeCount` was
 * already > 0. We *don't* gate on the 0→1 transition because the refcount
 * can drift if a previous drag's `pointerup` was missed (release outside
 * the window, alt-tab mid-drag, focus loss stealing pointer capture). With
 * a transition-only notify, the very next drag would silently skip the
 * listeners — and the content-width freeze would never engage.
 *
 * Listeners must therefore be idempotent for repeated `true` notifications:
 * applying the same lock twice is a no-op (e.g. setting `style.width` to the
 * already-locked value). `notify(false)` still only fires on the count→0
 * transition, so unlocks are not re-fired during normal nested drags.

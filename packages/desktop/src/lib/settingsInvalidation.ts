/**
 * Invalidate every query whose data derives from the settings JSON files —
 * not just the raw `settings` endpoints.
 *
 * Settings drive model selection, provider selection, and the agent catalog
 * (its default model/provider depend on the active Claude profile, which is a
 * setting). So a JSON edit — whether our own save or an external edit picked up
 * by the file watcher — must refresh those derived caches too, or the model
 * picker and provider toggles keep showing stale values.
 *
 * This deliberately spans two query-key shapes:
 *  - orval URL-string keys (`/api/.../settings`, `/api/.../model-settings`,
 *    `/api/.../provider-settings`), matched on the URL head; and
 *  - the hand-written custom keys in `api/agentRuntime.ts`
 *    (`["workspace"|"projects"|"features", "provider-settings", …]`,
 *    `["agent-catalog", …]`), matched structurally.
 *
 * Settings changes are rare and user-driven, so a slightly broad refetch here
 * is the right trade — correctness over shaving a few cache walks.
 */
/**
 * Coalesce bursts of settings invalidations into a leading refetch plus one
 * trailing refetch — the same leading+settle shape as `scheduleGitInvalidation`
 * (this variant is keyless and doesn't re-arm, since settings events are rare).
 *
 * A single settings save fans out into several `settings_event`s in quick
 * succession: our own atomic write, the file watcher's echo, and any sibling
 * `*.settings.json` touched by the cascade. Each event invalidates the
 * `agent-catalog` + provider/model caches, and those are mounted on hot paths
 * (every open session's composer and resolved-model context). Invalidating
 * once per raw event triggers a refetch + re-render wave per event; coalescing
 * collapses the burst so the wave fires at most twice per settling window.

/**
 * True when the window chrome includes the macOS traffic-light buttons.
 * The Electron shell uses `titleBarStyle: "hiddenInset"`, which places them
 * inside the web content area (~y=12, ending ~x=64 from the left edge), so
 * layouts near the top-left corner must reserve space for them. Gate that
 * clearance on this — remote-browser sessions and other platforms have no
 * traffic lights and would only get dead space.
 *
 * Both inputs are fixed for the process lifetime (the preload bridge is
 * injected before renderer modules evaluate, and the platform never changes),
 * so this is computed once at module load like `PLATFORM_IS_MAC` itself.

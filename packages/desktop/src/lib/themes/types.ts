/**
 * Theme system primitives.
 *
 * A theme bundles three flavors of color data:
 * 1. CSS variables consumed by Tailwind / index.css. A theme may carry these as
 *    *data* (`cssVars`, injected at runtime by `applyThemeToDocument`) or leave
 *    them authored as plain CSS rules under a `:root[data-theme="<id>"]` block.
 *    Both paths end up as the same custom properties on `<html>`; the data path
 *    is what makes user-authored themes possible.
 * 2. An xterm.js ITheme palette (canvas-rendered; can't read CSS variables).
 * 3. A label for the settings picker.
 *
 * CodeMirror uses CSS variables directly (its EditorView.theme rules become CSS
 * and inherit `var(--…)`), so there's no per-theme CodeMirror palette here —
 * the editor follows `data-theme` on the document automatically.

 *
 * The risk this can't detect at runtime is a theme with no matching rule: the

 * palette under another theme's name. It is not detectable by comparing against
 * an unmatchable id, because CadencR Dark deliberately *is* the `:root` block
 * (`theme-cadencr.css` declares `:root, :root[data-theme="cadencr-dark"]`) and
 * any theme may legitimately share a token with it. So that invariant — every
 * built-in carries `cssVars` or has a block of its own — is enforced where it
 * can be checked exactly, by `registry.test.ts`, and what remains here is the

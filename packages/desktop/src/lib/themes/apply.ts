 *
 * Themes that carry their tokens as data (every user theme, plus the ported
 * first-party ones) additionally have those values injected as a CSS rule for
 * the same selector — see `inject.ts`.
 *
 * `data-appearance` mirrors the theme's light/dark classification so chrome
 * that can't rely on Tailwind's media-query `dark:` variant (e.g. mono logos)
 * can invert correctly for Cadencr themes.
 *
 * The xterm.js terminal is canvas-rendered and can't read CSS — it has its
 * own bridge in the terminal components that listens to the same setting.

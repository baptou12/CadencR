/**
 * Fetch an image a pull request points at, through the service.

 * The renderer CSP is `img-src 'self' data: blob:`, so an `<img>` aimed at a
 * forge asset host (`avatars.githubusercontent.com`, an attachment CDN, a
 * badge) is blocked before the request leaves — and a private repository's
 * attachments need the forge token, which an `<img>` cannot carry either. The
 * service fetches the bytes with the right credentials and this returns them as
 * a Blob; callers turn it into a `blob:` object URL, which the CSP allows.
 *
 * `src` is passed exactly as the pull request body wrote it — the service
 * resolves relative and protocol-relative forms against the repository.

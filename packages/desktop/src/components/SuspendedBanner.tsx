/**
 * Small top-of-screen banner shown only while the OS is suspended (or in
 * the brief window before the renderer has reconciled with backend after
 * wake). Reads `usePowerStore.suspended`, which is set by `usePowerEvents`
 * from Electron's `powerMonitor` events.
 *
 * Provider-neutral: covers every active agent, no matter which provider.
 *
 * Styling follows the existing "warning-amber" treatment used by
 * `PermissionRequestPendingIndicator` so this looks at home in the rest of
 * the app (see DESIGN.md — amber = "needs attention").

/**
 * Leading terminal-prompt caret (`❯`) rendered in the input's gutter in place of
 * the serialized, zero-width leading `!`. It is monospace text sharing the
 * command's exact font metrics and responsive size (`text-sm`, bumped to `1rem`
 * on ≤767px like the editable), so caret and command sit on one baseline and
 * read as a single terminal line. It is also the clear control: a labeled,
 * focusable button that exits shell mode while keeping the typed command. One
 * persistent glyph keeps the touch state unambiguous — a hover-reveal icon is
 * force-shown on touch (see the touch affordance rule in `index.css`).

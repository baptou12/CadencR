/**
 * Reveal an FS-form file path inside a pierre file-tree model: expand each
 * ancestor folder in place, then scroll the file row into view and focus
 * it.
 *
 * Returns `false` if the file isn't (yet) part of the model's path set —
 * e.g. the tree is still loading or the file was just created and the
 * refetch hasn't landed. Callers should retry when `paths` next updates.
 *
 * Why not `resetPaths` with `initialExpandedPaths`? That rebuilds the
 * whole tree and clobbers virtualization/scroll state. `getItem` +
 * per-handle `expand()` mutates pierre's tree in place.
 *
 * Why the rAF on `scrollToPath`? `scrollToPath` enqueues a scroll request
 * whose `visibleIndex` is captured at call time. If we call it
 * synchronously after `expand()`, pierre's virtual-row list hasn't yet
 * picked up the newly-revealed descendants, so the request targets a
 * stale index and pierre silently drops it (see
 * `dist/render/FileTreeView.js` ~L1495: `getVisibleRows(idx, idx)[0] ??
 * null` → skip + clearScrollRequest). Deferring to the next animation
 * frame lets the expansion render commit first.
 *
 * `offset: "nearest"` keeps the scrollbar still when the row is already
 * in view, so flipping between visible tabs doesn't jitter.

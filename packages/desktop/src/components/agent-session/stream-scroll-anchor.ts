/**
 * Keeps the agent stream's reading position still while rows above it change
 * height — the "jumps when scrolling up".
 *
 * Virtuoso places rows from a size table in which a row it never rendered
 * carries an estimate: `defaultItemHeight`, or the last row's size for
 * prepended history. Scrolling up mounts those rows above the viewport at their
 * real height — hundreds to thousands of pixels for a Maximal-mode tool call —
 * and everything below is pushed down. Virtuoso does compensate, but a frame
 * late (its ResizeObserver work is deferred to the next animation frame) and
 * only while it believes the user is scrolling up: the reader sees frames of
 * another part of the conversation, blank frames, and compensation for growth
 * *below* the viewport too, such as a streamed reply.
 *
 * The guard owns that compensation against ground truth instead:
 *
 * 1. **Measure.** An anchor row — the first one whose top edge is on screen —
 *    is tracked in layout content coordinates. After every list commit
 *    (MutationObserver) and row resize (ResizeObserver), both of which run
 *    before paint, its drift is exactly how far content above it moved.
 * 2. **Bridge.** The drift is cancelled visually in the same frame with a
 *    `transform` on the item list. Scrolling instead would hand Virtuoso a
 *    scroll position its still-estimated size table maps to other rows, and it
 *    would render those. The footer stays put, so `scrollHeight` (and with it
 *    the scroll position) can't be clamped by the bridge.
 * 3. **Settle.** The bridge is converted into a real scroll offset inside
 *    Virtuoso's measurement pass (its `itemSize` callback, see
 *    {@link ScrollAnchorGuard.measureItem}): the one moment its size table
 *    catches up with the DOM, right before it re-reads `scrollTop`. Sizes and
 *    offset land together, so it never renders one without the other. A
 *    two-frame fallback settles drift that no measurement pass follows.
 * 4. **Arbitrate.** Virtuoso's own compensation still arrives through
 *    `scrollBy`; it is honoured only up to the drift measured and still
 *    pending — anything beyond that is growth it attributed to the wrong side
 *    of the viewport.
 *
 * Idle while bottom-stick is engaged (the bottom pin owns the viewport then)
 * and between a programmatic jump and the next user scroll input. Not used on
 * iOS: Virtuoso corrects through its own deviation offset there, and writing
 * `scrollTop` during momentum scrolling fights it (see `observeListGrowth`).

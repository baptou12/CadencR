 * One theme, offered for choosing: its swatch, its name, its appearance.

 * A radio rather than a toggle — everywhere a theme is offered, exactly one of
 * the set is chosen — so the container has to be a `radiogroup` and own the
 * arrow-key movement between cards, including which card is the tab stop.
 * Shape is the caller's: the drawer lays these out as a fixed-width carousel,
 * the create dialog as a grid.

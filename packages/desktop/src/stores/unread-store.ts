/**
 * Tracks which features have something the user has not seen yet:
 * - unread: the agent finished its turn (agent → idle) while the user was NOT
 *   viewing that feature, or the user marked it unread by hand;
 * - failed: the turn stopped on an error while nobody was looking.
 * The sidebar renders a green check for unread and a strong error mark for
 * failed; both clear the moment the conversation is opened.
 *
 * Per-client by design — "unread" is relative to *this* window (a remote phone
 * and the host each track their own), so nothing goes to the backend. The
 * marks and their order are kept in localStorage (`unread-marks-storage.ts`)
 * so a reload of this window keeps every pending "review this" and "this
 * failed" instead of silently dropping them from the For me list.
 *
 * Conforms to frontend-performance.md: consumers read the per-feature boolean
 * via `useIsFeatureUnread`, never the whole map.

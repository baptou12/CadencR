/**

 * Per-client and in-memory by design — "unread" is relative to *this* window
 * (a remote phone and the host each track their own), and there is nothing to
 * restore on reload: a fresh load has read nothing, so it shows no dots.
 *
 * Conforms to frontend-performance.md: consumers read the per-feature boolean
 * via `useIsFeatureUnread`, never the whole map.

//! Shared PTY-streaming machinery for `commit` and `push`.
//!
//! Both operations follow the same pipeline:
//!   1. Snapshot WS subscribers for the feature once up front.
//!   2. Spin up an mpsc channel that the PTY reader writes chunks into.
//!   3. Fanout task drains that channel and broadcasts each chunk as a
//!      `<op>.output` envelope to the snapshotted senders.
//!   4. Emit a `<op>.start` envelope, push a synthetic header line into
//!      the channel so the dialog has something to render immediately,
//!      run the operation, then emit a `<op>.complete` envelope.
//!
//! This module owns steps (1)–(4) generically; callers supply only:
//!   - the operation name (used as the WS `action` prefix),
//!   - the synthetic header line,
//!   - the closure that actually runs the PTY-backed git command.
//!
//! The pre-extraction `commit_push.rs` / `push.rs` versions of this logic
//! were byte-for-byte equivalent except for the action string and header
//! text — keep them in lock-step here so a change to the envelope shape
//! (e.g. adding a field) lands on both surfaces simultaneously.

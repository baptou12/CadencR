//! What Cadencr leaves in a theme folder for whoever is editing it.
//!
//! A theme opens as a project with `theme.json` in one pane and an agent in the
//! other, and until these files existed the agent had nothing but the document
//! itself to infer the format from. That works for colors — the keys are CSS
//! custom properties — and fails for [`chrome`](super::chrome), where seeing
//! `"chassis": "rail"` tells you nothing about what else is allowed.
//!
//! So the folder carries its own documentation: `THEME.md` for prose and
//! `theme.schema.json` for the machine-checkable half, the latter generated from
//! the same constants the validator uses.
//!
//! And it carries its own *boundary*. An agent that can't express something in
//! `theme.json` will look for another way to satisfy the request, and in a
//! development checkout the app's own stylesheets are a few directories up — one
//! did exactly that, editing the shared segmented-tab rules to recolor a single
//! theme. `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` say the folder is the whole world, and say
//! what to do instead: report the limit. See [`AGENT_FILE_NAMES`].
//!
//! Both are the app's, not the theme's, and are kept out of git accordingly —
//! see [`exclude_from_git`].

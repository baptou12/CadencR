//! The project a theme is built in.
//!
//! A theme is edited the way everything else in Cadencr is edited: in a project,
//! with the file in the editor, an agent beside it and git underneath. Rather
//! than teach the runtime a second notion of "where does this agent run", a
//! theme gets what every conversation already has — a project row whose `path`
//! *is* the theme directory, and a conversation inside it. Every existing path
//! (session init, prompt send, checkpoints, the editor, the Git tab) then works
//! with no special case, and the theme file the app is watching is the very file
//! the agent writes, so the app restyles itself as it is edited.
//!
//! Two pieces of setup are what make that true rather than nearly true:
//!
//!  - The directory is made a git repository. A theme project is a project; the
//!    Git tab is where the user reads what the agent changed and how to undo it.
//!  - Worktrees are off (`skip`, as the feature setting and the project
//!    default). A worktree would hand the agent a *copy* of the theme somewhere
//!    else, and the live app would go on painting from a file nobody edits.
//!
//! `projects.kind = 'theme'` hides none of this — it is how the theme finds its
//! project again, to open it, rename it and delete it.

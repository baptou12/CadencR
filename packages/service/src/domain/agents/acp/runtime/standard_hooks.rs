/// Standard ACP v1 behavior, with no provider-specific extension whatsoever.
///
/// The three methods below are the trait's only required ones — deliberately so,
/// since every built-in provider has to make an explicit decision about tool
/// naming and mode mapping. An agent Cadencr knows nothing about has no such
/// decision to make, so this impl answers each of them the only neutral way:
///
/// - **tool names** pass through unchanged. `events_tool_call_name.rs` already
///   maps the standard ACP `kind` values (`read`, `edit`, `execute`, …) onto
///   Cadencr's canonical names; a rename table here would be guessing at a
///   provider-native vocabulary.
/// - **tool inputs** pass through unchanged. Standard ACP `rawInput` is what the
///   agent meant, and rewriting it would change what the user approves.
/// - **permission modes** are not mapped. Modes are negotiated per session and
///   reported by `session/new`; mapping a Cadencr mode onto a guessed provider
///   mode id would push the session into a mode the agent never advertised.
///
/// Every other hook keeps its trait default, which declines the optional
/// capability rather than claiming it. This is what the generic ACP provider
/// (`providers/installed/`) spawns with, and what the runtime's own tests use
/// when they need hooks that add nothing.

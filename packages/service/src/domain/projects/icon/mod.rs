//! Project icon discovery and delivery.
//!
//! A project can display a logo taken from its own repository instead of the
//! generic accent dot. Two endpoints back that:
//!
//! - `GET /api/projects/{id}/icon-candidates` scans the repo's git-tracked
//!   files for plausible logos and returns them ranked, best guess first.
//! - `GET /api/projects/{id}/icon` serves the bytes of whichever file the user
//!   settled on (the `icon_path` project setting).
//!
//! The scan is deliberately cheap — one `git ls-files` plus a `stat` per image
//! — so the frontend can re-run it on demand from Project Settings.

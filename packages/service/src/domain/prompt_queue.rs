//! Prompts the user queued for after the agent's current turn.

//! The composer's "queue" gesture (⌘Enter while the agent works) parks a
//! message here instead of steering the running turn. One is delivered per
//! finished turn, oldest first, as an ordinary user message (persisted and
//! mirrored like any prompt); until then it can be edited, deleted or sent
//! right away. Changes broadcast a bare `{session_id}` ping on
//! `prompt_queue_events_tx`; clients re-fetch the list.
